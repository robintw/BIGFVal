This repository contains all of the code for reproducible the results of the BIGF Integrated Water Vapour validation part of XXX (paper reference here).

To get going with reproducing the results:
1. load a recent version of R (I suggest you use RStudio to make it easier)
2. Change the directory to the location of your cloned version of this repository
3. Run ``source('go.r')``
4. You should find that the validation calculation process starts. This may take some time to complete.
5. Run individual files in the 'src' folder to obtain the specific results shown in the paper
